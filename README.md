# Generating-Electricity-with-a-Piezoelectric-Transducer-and-Arduino-UNO
This project uses a piezoelectric transducer to generate electricity when subjected to mechanical stress (e.g., pressing or tapping). The generated energy is used to illuminate an LED and monitored using an Arduino Uno.

Materials Required
Arduino Uno
Piezoelectric transducer
1N4007 diode
Capacitor (10 µF or 100 µF, 25V)
LED
Resistor (220 ohms)
Breadboard and jumper wires
Circuit Diagram Description
Piezo Transducer: Connect one terminal to a rectifier diode (1N4007). The cathode (striped end) of the diode is connected to the positive terminal of the capacitor.
Capacitor: Stores the charge generated by the piezo transducer.
LED Circuit: The positive terminal of the capacitor is connected to an LED (via a 220-ohm resistor).
Arduino Monitoring:
Connect the positive terminal of the capacitor to an analog pin on the Arduino (e.g., A0).
Connect the negative terminal of the capacitor to the Arduino’s GND.

Steps to Implement
Assemble the circuit as described above.
Connect the Arduino Uno to your computer via USB.
Open the Arduino IDE, paste the provided code, and upload it to the Arduino.
Open the Serial Monitor to observe the voltage generated when pressing the piezo transducer.
How It Works
When mechanical stress is applied to the piezo transducer, it generates an electrical charge.
The diode rectifies this charge, storing it in the capacitor.
The Arduino reads the voltage from the capacitor and controls the LED based on the generated voltage.
